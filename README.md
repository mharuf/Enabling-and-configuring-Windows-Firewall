<h1>Enabling and configuring Microsoft Windows Firewall</h1>
I completed this project on coursera with IBM. I was taught how to navigate through the settings page of Microsoft Windows to arrive at the Windows Firewall and network protection page, where I was taught how to enable firewalls for each network: Domain, Private, and Public. I was then taught how to configure the firewalls to block certain apps from communicating on certain networks, whilst allowing others to do so. Following this, I was taught how to utilise the advanced settings for the firewall to create more in-depth configurations.
